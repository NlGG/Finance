    "both short and long operations. The long (respectively, short)\n",
    "position makes profits when the subsequent market price goes\n",
    "higher (respectively, lower).\n",
    "The financial data are captured by our own trading system\n",
    "in each trading day and the historic data is maintained in\n",
    "a database. In our experiment, the minute-level close prices\n",
    "are used, implying that there is a 1-min interval between the\n",
    "price pt and pt+1. The historic data of the three contracts in\n",
    "the minute resolutions are shown in Fig. 4. In this one-year\n",
    "period, the IF contracts accumulate more ticks than commodity\n",
    "data because the daily trading period of IF is much longer than\n",
    "commodity contracts.\n",
    "From Fig. 4, it is also interesting to note that these three contracts\n",
    "exhibit quite different market patterns. IF data get very\n",
    "large upward and downward movements in the tested period.\n",
    "The AG contract, generally, shows a downward trend and the\n",
    "SU has no obvious direction in the testing period. For practical\n",
    "usage, some other issues related to trading should also be\n",
    "considered. We have summarized some detailed information\n",
    "about these contracts in Table I. The inherent values of these\n",
    "three contracts are evaluated by China Yuan (CNY) per point\n",
    "(CNY/pnt). For instance, in the IF data, the increase (decrease)\n",
    "in one point may lead to a reward of 300 CNY for a long\n",
    "(respectively, short) position and vice versa. The TCs charged\n",
    "by the brokerage company is also provided. By considering\n",
    "other risky factors, a much higher c is set in (1). It is five\n",
    "times higher than the real TCs.\n",
    "The raw price changes of the last 45 min and the momentum\n",
    "change to the previous 3 h, 5 h, 1 day, 3 days, and 10 days\n",
    "is directly used as the input of the trading system (ft ∈ R50).\n",
    "In the fuzzy learning part, each of the 50 input nodes are\n",
    "connected with three fuzzy membership functions to seek for\n",
    "the first-level fuzzy representation in R150. Then, the fuzzy\n",
    "layer is sequentially passed through four deep transformation\n",

    "B. Details on Deep Training\n",
    "In this section, we discuss some details related to deep\n",
    "training. In practice, the system is trained by two sequential\n",

    "DENG et al.: DDR LEARNING FOR FINANCIAL SIGNAL REPRESENTATION AND TRADING 7\n",
    "steps of initialization and online updating. In the initialization\n",
    "step, the first 15 000 time points of each time series\n",
    "in Fig. 4 (red parts) are employed for system warming up.\n",
    "It is noted that these initialization data will not be used for\n",
    "out-of-sample tests. After initialization, the parameters in the\n",
    "RDNN are iteratively updated in an online manner with the\n",
    "recently released data. The online updating strategy allows\n",
    "the model to get aware of the latest market condition and\n",
    "revise its parameters accordingly.\n",
    "In practice, the first 15 000 time points are used to set up the\n",
    "RDNN and the well-trained system is exploited to trade the\n",
    "time points from 15 001 to 20 000. Then, the sliding window of\n",
    "the training data is moved 5000 ticks forward covering a new\n",
    "training set from 5000 to 20 000. As indicated in Section IV,\n",
    "the training phase of the RDNN is composed of two main\n",
    "steps of layerwise parameter initialization and fine tuning. It is\n",
    "clarified here that the parameter initialization implementations\n",
    "are only performed in the first round of training, i.e., on the\n",
    "first 15 000 ticks. With the sliding window of the training\n",
    "set moving ahead, the optimal parameters obtained from\n",
    "the last training round are directly used as the initialized\n",
    "values.\n",
    "FDDR is a highly nonconvex system and only a local minimum\n",
    "is expected after convergence. Besides, the overfitting\n",
    "phenomenon is a known drawback faced by most DNNs.\n",
    "To mitigate the disturbances of overfitting, we adopt two\n",
    "convenient strategies that have been proved to be powerful in\n",
    "practice. The first strategy is the widely used early stopping\n",
    "method for DNN training. The system is only trained for\n",
    "100 epochs with a gradient decreasing parameter be ηc = 0.97\n",
    "in Algorithm 1. Second, we conduct model selection to select\n",
    "a good model for the out-of-sample data. To achieve this\n",
    "goal, 15 000 training points are divided into two sets as\n",
    "RDNN training set (first 12 000) and validation set (last 3000).\n",
    "On the first 12 000 time points, FDDR is trained for 5 times\n",
    "and the best one is selected on the next 3000 blind points.\n",
    "Such validation helps to exclude some highly overfitted NNs\n",
    "from the training set.\n",
    "Another challenge in training RDNN comes from the\n",
    "gradient vanishing issue, and we have introduced the\n",
    "task-aware BPTT method to cope with this problem. To prove\n",
    "its effectiveness, we show the training performance with\n",
    "the comparison with the typical BPTT method. The trading\n",
    "model is trained on the first 12 000 points of the IF data\n",
    "in Fig. 4(a). The objective function values (accumulated\n",
    "rewards) of the two methods along with the training epochs\n",
    "are shown in Fig. 5. From the comparisons, it is apparent\n",
    "that the task-aware BPTT outperforms the BPTT method in\n",
    "making more rewards (accumulated trading profits). Moreover,\n",
    "the task-aware BPTT requires less iterative steps for\n",
    "convergence.\n",
    "C. General Evaluations\n",
    "In this section, we evaluate the DDR trading system on\n",
    "practical data. The system is compared with other RL systems\n",
    "for online trading. The first competitor is the DRL system [17].\n",
    "Besides, the sparse coding-inspired optimal training (SCOT)\n",
    "Fig. 5. Training epochs and the corresponding rewards by training the DRNN\n",
    "by (a) task-aware BPTT and (b) normal BPTT. The training data are the first\n",
    "12 000 data points in Fig. 4(a).\n",
    "system [19] is also evaluated, which uses shallow feature\n",
    "learning part of sparse coding.2 Finally, the results of DDR\n",
    "and its FDDR are also reported.\n",
    "In the previous discussions, the reward function defined\n",
    "for RL is regarded as the TPs gained in the training period.\n",
    "Compared with total TP, in modern portfolio theory, the riskadjusted\n",
    "profits are more widely used to evaluate a trading\n",
    "system’s performance. In this paper, we will also consider an\n",
    "alternative reward function into the RL part, i.e., SR, which\n",
    "has been widely used in many trading related works [42], [43].\n",
    "The SR is defined as the ratio of average return to standard\n",
    "deviation of the returns calculated in period 1, . . . , T ,\n",
    "i.e., USR\n",
    "T = (mean(Rt )/std(Rt )). To simplify the expression,\n",
    "we follow the same idea in DRL [17] to use the moving\n",
    "SR instead. In general, moving SR gets the first-order Taylor\n",
    "expansion of typical SR and then updates the value in an\n",
    "incremental manner. Please refer to [17, Sec. 2.4] for detailed\n",
    "derivations. Different trading systems are trained with both\n",
    "TP and SR as the RL objectives. The details of the profit\n",
    "and loss (P&L) curves are shown in Fig. 6. The quantitative\n",
    "evaluations are summarized in Table II, where the testing\n",
    "performances are also reported in the forms of TP and SR. The\n",
    "performance of buying and holding (B&H) is also reported in\n",
    "Table II as the comparison baseline. From the experimental\n",
    "results, three observations can be found as follows.\n",
    "The first observation is that all the methods achieved much\n",
    "more profits in the trending market. Since we have allowed\n",
    "short operation in trading, the trader can also make money in\n",
    "the downward market. This can be denmonstrated from the\n",
    "IF data that Chinese market exhibits an increasing trend in\n",
    "the first, followed by a sudden drop. FDDR makes profits in\n",
    "either case. It is also observed that the P&L curve suffers\n",
    "a drawback during the transition period from the increasing\n",
    "trend to the decreasing trend. This is possible due to\n",
    "the significant differences in the training and testing data.\n",
    "In general, the RL model is particularly suitable to be applied\n",
    "to the trending market condition.\n",
    "Second, FDDR and DDR generally outperform the other\n",
    "two competitors on all the markets. SCOT also gains better\n",
    "performance than DRL in most conditions. This observation\n",
    "verifies that feature learning indeed contributes in\n",
    "improving the trading performance. Besides, the DL methods\n",
    "\n",
    "(FDDR and DDR) make more profits with higher SR on\n",
    "all the tests than the shallow learning approach (SCOT).\n",
    "Among the two DL methods, adding an extra layer for fuzzy\n",
    "representation seems to be a good way to further improve the\n",
    "results. This claim can be easily verified from Table II and\n",
    "Fig. 6 in which FDDR wins the DDR on all the tests except\n",
    "the one in Fig. 6(g). As claimed in the last paragraph, the\n",
    "DRL is a trend following system that may suffer losses on\n",
    "the market with small volatility. However, it is observed from\n",
    "the results that even on the nontrending period, e.g., on the\n",
    "SU data or in the early period of the IF data, FDDR is also\n",
    "effective to make the positive accumulation from the swing\n",
    "market patterns. Such finding successfully verifies another\n",
    "important property of fuzzy learning in reducing market\n",
    "uncertainties.\n",
    "Third, exploiting SR as the RL objective always leads to\n",
    "more reliable performances. Such reliability can be observed\n",
    "from both the SR quantity in Table II and the shapes of the\n",
    "P&L curves in Fig. 6. It is observed from Table II that the\n",
    "highest profits on the IF data were made by optimizing the TP\n",
    "as the objective in DDR. However, the SR on that testing\n",
    "condition is worse than the other. In portfolio management,\n",
    "rather than struggling for the highest profits with high risk, it\n",
    "is more intellectual to make good profits within acceptable risk\n",
    "level. Therefore, in practical usage, it is still recommended to\n",
    "use the SR as the reward function for RL.\n",
    "In conclusion, the RL framework is perhaps a trend-based\n",
    "trading strategy and could make reliable profits on the markets\n",
    "with large price movement (no matter in which direction).\n",
    "The DL-based trading systems generally outperform other\n",
    "DRL models either with or without shallow feature learning.\n",
    "By incorporating the fuzzy learning concept into the system,\n",
    "the FDDR can even generate good results in the nontrending\n",
    "period. When training a deep trading model, it is suggested to\n",
    "use the SR as the RL objective which balances the profit and\n",
    "the risk well."
